      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p> I am a recent Computer Science graduate with a minor in Mathematics from The American University in Cairo
        (AUC). I've built projects ranging from fileless malware simulations to full-stack web apps and gained
        professional experience as a Frontend Engineering Intern at BoundryLabs. I enjoy tackling complex problems,
        learning new technologies, and creating secure, impactful digital solutions.

              Developed malware that executed entirely in memory without leaving traces on disk. Set up to restart
              automatically with system-level priviledges and simulated real attack behaviors like capturing screenshots
              and communicating with a command server. Applied hiding techniques including encryption and misleading
              file names to avoid detection. This project showed how challenging it is to defend against memory-only
              threats and why security teams need behavior-based monitoring, not just signature scanning.

              Built a controlled test network to exploit a critical weakness in WPA2 Wi-Fi security. By manipulating the
              connection handshake, I forced devices to reuse encryption keys, which allowed me to capture and decrypt
              supposedly secure traffic. Used Wireshark to verify the attack worked and confirmed that unpatched devices
              exposed their data. This demonstrated why keeping network devices updated is crucial for security.

              As part of a Web Security course, I performed end-to-end security web applications. First, I found
              vulnerabilities by testing the apps without seeing the code (black-box testing). Then, I dove into the
              source code to understand exactly how the flaws worked and fixed them using secure coding
              practices—validating user input and using safe database queries. Verified all fixes using professional
              security tools. This project demonstrates both offensive skills (finding exploits) and defensive ability
              (writing secure code).

              As a Front-End Engineering Intern at BoundryLabs, I implemented new functionality for a large-scale
              application while maintaining code quality. My work included adding animations and loading indicators,
              implementing multi-language support, and fetching user-specific data from the database. I collaborated
              closely with designers using Figma and backend engineers, contributing tested and bug-fixed code that
              enhanced the app's responsiveness and user experience. This internship strengthened my understanding of
              full-stack collaboration, front-end engineering, and software delivery in a professional agile
              environment.

              MindWell is a research-driven project aimed at enhancing mental health support through artificial
              intelligence. Conducted as my B.Sc. Computer Science capstone project, it focused on building a
              comprehensive dataset and AI models to detect and classify 15 types of cognitive distortions (unhealthy
              thinking patterns) in written text. I contributed to data collection from social media and AI-generated
              text, annotation design, and model evaluation, while co-developing a framework to make AI decisions more
              explainable. Our models achieved ~76% accuracy, significantly outperforming baselines (36–40%) and
              demonstrating potential for ethical AI in mental health contexts. The project culminated in a technical
              research paper documenting our dataset, methodology, and results.
