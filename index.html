      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p> I am a recent Computer Science graduate with a minor in Mathematics from The American University in Cairo
        (AUC). I've built projects ranging from fileless malware simulations to full-stack web apps and gained
        professional experience as a Frontend Engineering Intern at BoundryLabs. I enjoy tackling complex problems,
        learning new technologies, and creating secure, impactful digital solutions.

          <div class="project-details">
            <p>
              I built a controlled Wi-Fi lab to demonstrate the KRACK attack on WPA2 by replaying handshake Message-3 to
              force key reinstallation, which resets nonces and enables packet decryption/replay. The setup used a Kali
              attacker with a hostapd AP and TP-Link USB adapter (monitor/injection), Vanhoef’s KRACK PoC, and Wireshark
              for analysis; the victim was a Raspberry Pi (Raspbian 2016-05-13, wpa_supplicant 2.2). I replayed
              Message-3, captured the handshake and data frames, and verified nonce reuse and traffic exposure in
              Wireshark, confirming the vulnerable client state (“this is bad”) and demonstrating selective
              decryption/replay.

            <p>Conducted a comprehensive cybersecurity assessment for a university transitioning to hybrid learning. My
              team and I analyzed the institution’s digital infrastructure across six key domains—Security & Risk
              Management, Asset Security, Communication & Network Security, Identity & Access Management, Security
              Assessment & Training, and Security Operations. We evaluated existing controls, identified
              vulnerabilities, and proposed solutions aligned with ISO/IEC 27001 standards. My focus areas included risk
              assessment, data protection, and network security, emphasizing TLS/IPsec encryption, RBAC and MFA access
              control, and incident response planning. The final report delivered actionable recommendations to enhance
              the university’s cybersecurity posture, ensure GDPR compliance, and strengthen resilience against emerging
              threats.</p>

              parameterized queries—by modifying the Go codebase, and verified mitigations using Burp Suite and
              Wireshark. The project demonstrates both offensive skills (exploit discovery and chaining) and defensive

              GraphQL APIs. I collaborated closely with designers using Figma and backend engineers using Deno,
              contributing to tested and bug-fixed code that enhanced the app’s responsiveness and user experience. This

            <p>MindWell is a research-driven project aimed at enhancing mental health support through the use of large
              language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 and DeepSeek. Conducted as part of my B.Sc. Computer Science capstone
              at AUC, the project focused on building a comprehensive dataset and modeling pipeline to detect and
              classify 15 cognitive distortion types in written text. I contributed to multiple stages—including data
              collection from social media and LLM-generated text, annotation design, and model evaluation—while
              co-developing a Decision-of-Thought (DoT) framework to improve interpretability. Our models achieved ~76%
              accuracy, outperforming baselines (36–40%) and demonstrating potential for explainable, ethical AI in
              mental health contexts. The project culminated in a technical research paper documenting our dataset,
